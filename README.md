### `DISCLAIMER:`
> This prototype is obviously not supposed to be perfect or in anyway a representation of how I would approach this if it was actually being made professionally. It is just a light example of how the slot swapping can be achieved when using Rodux and Roact.

This is a simple client only prototype of an Inventory system on Roblox. It utilizes Roact and Rodux (with Rodux integration using RoduxHooks) to allow the player to move items in an inventory from slot to slot.
